# 🚀 Python, NumPy, Pandas & Data Science: My Learning Journey

## Introduction

 **Python, NumPy, Pandas**, and **Data Science**! 🎉 With a solid background in Python 🐍, this  deepened my understanding of data analysis and manipulation, equipping me with powerful tools to tackle real-world data problems. 

### What I’ve Covered:
- **Python**: Built on my existing Python knowledge to write efficient, clean code for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Mastered array operations, numerical computations, and matrix handling for data-heavy tasks.
- **Pandas**: Learned how to manipulate, clean, and analyze complex datasets using DataFrames, including techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Data Science**: Applied these tools to real-world datasets, exploring trends, performing analysis, and preparing data for visualization.

## Why I’m Sharing This

📊 Data science is becoming an essential field, and I’m eager to share my progress to inspire others on the same journey. In this repository, you’ll find code samples, mini-projects, and examples that highlight key techniques and concepts I’ve learned.

## What's Next?

I’m currently working on a data science project that integrates everything I’ve learned 🔨. From data cleaning to in-depth analysis, I’ll be applying these skills to tackle complex problems. Stay tuned 👀—I’ll be sharing the project soon!


## Example Code Snippets

### 1. Creating a NumPy, Pandas Array and Performing Basic Operations
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
array = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

# Basic mathematical operations
squared_array = np.square(array)
print("Original Array:", array)
print("Squared Array:", squared_array)




import pandas as pd

# Creating a simple DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35],
        'Occupation': ['Engineer', 'Doctor', 'Artist']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Displaying the DataFrame
print(df)

# Filtering data
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 28]
print("\nFiltered Data (Age > 28):\n", filtered_df)
